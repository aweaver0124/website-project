            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my website! This is my first project working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Although I've only just started,
                I intend to create an eye-catching and dynamic webpage for all viewers to enjoy. Please allow me to introduce myself and follow 
                along on my coding journey.

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Growing up in Texas, I experienced alot of odd, ever-changing weather<em>(mostly just suffocating heat, though)</em>. And much like the weather, I'm 
            also incredibly indecisive. I graduated from Granbury High School, headed off to Texas State, and left with a Bachelor of Business Administration in Marketing.
            What I soon came to realize, however, is that I didn't necessarily want to do marketing. I wanted to travel... or go back to school... or <em>that's it!</em>
            I wanted to try my hand in Software Development and to learn the science behind some of my favorites activities.</p>
